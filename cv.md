### Briefly about myself:
I received a diploma of environmental engineer in 2009 and started working at an industrial rubber production plant as a roller in a laboratory for the production of rubber by emulsified polymerization of styrene. I was quickly promoted to chemist. A few years later I moved to the laboratory of sanitary and environmental control. By the time my parental leave ended, I began to realize that I was no longer interested in working as a chemist. I remembered my interest in programming at school and decided to study Python and began to consider vacancies for a quality control engineer, but the more I immersed myself in testing, the more I realized that I liked to create code more. I began to study HTML and CSS in more depth, and realized that I really like it. The next step was to register for The Rolling Scopes course.
